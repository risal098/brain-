# brain++
a brainf*ck interpreter with additional symbols ";" and ":" that have unique function/behavior that increase productivity in brainf*ck programming
(inspired by braiF interpreter tasks in codeabbey)
this program are made with python programming language.
what make this program different with any other brainF*ck interpreter?
- this program support nested loops
- this program can handle integer input
- this program increase productivity in brainF programming
- this program support print with ":" symbol

so in conclusion, you can use this program for education purpose of brainF programming and also python programming

============================================================================================
## Tutorial:
- this program require 2 input (one of the is optional)
- input 1 is the input of code/symbols in brainF
- input 2 is the input of integer number (this one is optional)

for example 
- input 1 = ++++-:
- input 2= 

- output= 3
- array=[3,0,0,...]

another example
- input 1 = ;++:>;:
- input 2= 10 20

- output= 12 20
- array= [12,20,0,...]

as you can see that ":" symbol print the current column/index (column/index that are pointed by the current pointer)
and as you can see that ";" symbol return integer input, so the first ";" will return the first integer number (10) and the second ";" return the second number (20)

hope you enjoy :)

# NOTE:
this progarm require ":" in order to print output (current index/column), 
else output will be empty, but u can still see what happen in array even if u "forget" to put ":".

## (array output will always appear below the output)
